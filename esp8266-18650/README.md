The simplest, cheapest, most do-it-yourself IOT platform.

The purpose of this project is quickly and cheaply deploy fully wireless, battery-powered digital sensor.  It takes about 20 minutes to go from parts to a functioning device.  Fully charged, the batteries will power the device for over a year.

It requires no special equipment other than a 3D Printer and a Raspberry Pi (running Raspbian).
