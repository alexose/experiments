The simplest, cheapest, most do-it-yourself IOT platform.

The purpose of this project is quickly and cheaply deploy fully wireless, battery-powered digital sensor.  It takes about 45 minutes to go from parts to a functioning device.  Fully charged, the battery will power the device for over a year.

It requires no special equipment other than a Raspberry Pi (running Raspbian), which we'll need to program the ESP-01 board.

Procedure
---------

First, source all of the parts listed above.  If you really want to drive costs down, consider buying in bulk.  You can also source 18650 batteries from old laptop batteries for extra cost savings.

Before we begin plugging things in, you'll want to [modify your ESP-01 slightly](http://www.instructables.com/id/Making-ESP8266-01-module-breadboard-friendly/) in order to use it with a broadboard.

Assemble the breadboard according to the schematic below.

(Schematic coming soon...)
